🕵️ Recon Checklist for No‑Name Android Radios
1. Gather System Info
About Device screen

Note the Build number / Build ID (often looks like YT9216B_00002_V001 or 8227L_demo).

Record the Android version and Kernel version.

CPU‑Z or AIDA64 (install via APK)

Identify the SoC (Allwinner T3, Rockchip PX30, Mediatek 8227L, etc.).

Check RAM size and storage type (NAND vs eMMC).

2. Identify the Board
Pull the unit and look at the silkscreen on the PCB. Common IDs:

YT9216B, YT9217, 8227L, AC8227L, PX30, PX5, PX6.

Photograph the board for reference—community forums love visual confirmation.

3. Extract Firmware Details
In Android, dial *#*#2846579#*#* or similar service codes (varies by unit) to access hidden menus.

Use adb shell (enable Developer Options → USB Debugging) and run:

bash
adb shell getprop | grep ro.build
adb shell cat /proc/cpuinfo
This gives you the exact build fingerprint and CPU family.

4. Match to Firmware Families
8227L / YT9216B → Tons of GitHub/XDA resources (patched ROMs, TWRP, root).

Allwinner T3 / T8 → PhoenixSuit flashing tools, firmware dumps on 4PDA/XDA.

Rockchip PX series → Rockchip Batch Tool or AndroidTool, more “premium” units.

XYAuto / FYAuto → Firmware hosted on XYGala server (login: Xyauto / 123456).

5. Backup Before Anything
Use adb pull to grab /system, /vendor, and /boot partitions.

If possible, dump the entire NAND/eMMC with SP Flash Tool or Rockchip AndroidTool.

This is your “lifeline” if a flash goes sideways.

6. Community Cross‑Check
Post your Build ID + board photos on XDA’s Android Head Unit forum.

Search GitHub with your Build ID (e.g. YT9216B site:github.com).

Compare your findings with firmware packages—exact match is critical.

⚡ Tools to Have Ready
ADB + Fastboot (basic Android debugging).

SP Flash Tool (for Mediatek).

PhoenixSuit (for Allwinner).

Rockchip AndroidTool (for PX series).

USB OTG cable and a known‑good USB stick (for update.zip installs).

Multimeter / UART adapter (for recovery if bricked).

This checklist will get you from “mystery box” to “I know exactly which firmware family I’m dealing with.” Once you’ve nailed that, we can dive into the actual flashing workflow and whether there are patched ROMs that bump your Android version.

Do you want me to sketch out a decision tree—like “If it’s 8227L → go here, if it’s Allwinner → use this tool, if it’s Rockchip → follow this path”—so you’ve got a visual map of the upgrade routes?
